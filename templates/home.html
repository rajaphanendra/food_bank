    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Food Bank</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; padding: 20px;">Currently, we are observing an alarming increase in the number of individuals experiencing severe hunger, with some unfortunate cases
        resulting in loss of life. Considering this distressing situation, a small group of volunteers has taken the initiative to organize
        food donations. Generous donors can contribute various packaged food items such as bread, fruits, cookies, and more to the local
        food bank, thereby providing essential nourishment to those in need. To manage these donations eï¬€ectively, an administrator will
        oversee the food bank's application. The administrator's responsibilities include receiving food items from donors, inspecting their
        expiration dates, and making necessary updates or removals of donated items. Based on the expiry date and available raw food we will
        cook the food or prepare the meals and severed to the recipients based on the expiration. Following the appropriate food safety to
        serve the best quality. The primary objective of our application is to alleviate hunger by ensuring that those who require sustenance
        are adequately fed.</p>
